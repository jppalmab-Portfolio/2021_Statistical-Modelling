This project contains all the reports, data and code of the course "Statistic for Data Analytics" of the MSc in Data Analytics. The repo have two folders:

1. Multiple Regression Analysis
**Abstract**—A multiple Regression Model is a powerful tool when you want to predict a numerical value by a set of other variables. This report provides insights for an understanding of the criteria that dictate the amount of credit card debt by financial behaviour of 687 customers. The final model is a parsimonious four variables subset that explained 73% of the dependent variable variance and respected all the Ordinary Least Square assumptions.

2. Time series and Logistic Regression
**Abstract**—The paper explores the Time Series Analysis and Logistic Regression method applied to two different data frames. The result shows that the suitable Time Series Analysis is a SARIMA model and regular Logistic Regression model in contrast with the model using PCA techniques.
