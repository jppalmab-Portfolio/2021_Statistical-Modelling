# 2021_Statistical-Modelling
`[R | Multiple Regression | Logistic Regression | Time series]` 

Welcome to the "Statistical Modelling" repository! This project contains all the reports, data, and code from the course "Statistics for Data Analytics" of the MSc in Data Analytics. The repository is divided into two folders, each focusing on different statistical modelling techniques.

## Folder 1: Multiple Regression Analysis

**Abstract:** 
The Multiple Regression Analysis folder contains insights into the criteria that dictate the amount of credit card debt based on the financial behavior of 687 customers. This report provides a comprehensive understanding of multiple regression models as a powerful tool for predicting numerical values using a set of other variables. The final model presented in the report is a parsimonious subset of four variables, which explains 73% of the variance in the dependent variable. The model adheres to all Ordinary Least Square assumptions, ensuring its validity and reliability.

## Folder 2: Time Series and Logistic Regression
**Abstract:** 
The Time Series and Logistic Regression folder explores the application of time series analysis and logistic regression methods to two different datasets. The analysis delves into the appropriate use of time series analysis techniques, identifying the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model as the optimal choice. Additionally, regular logistic regression models are employed for the analysis, demonstrating their effectiveness in contrasting with a model utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques.

## Repository Contents:

1. Multiple Regression Analysis Folder:
  - Reports: Detailed reports providing insights into the criteria influencing credit card debt based on financial behavior.
